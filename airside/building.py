        Find intersection between a ray and a line segment using parametric equations.

        COORDINATE SYSTEM:
        - x-axis: East/West direction (affects longitude)
        - y-axis: North/South direction (affects latitude)
        - ray_direction.x = East component (sin(heading))
        - ray_direction.y = North component (cos(heading))

        MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
        We solve for the intersection point using parametric equations:

        Ray equation:         P(t_ray) = ray_start + t_ray * ray_direction
        Line segment equation: L(t_seg) = line_start + t_seg * line_vector

        At intersection: P(t_ray) = L(t_seg)

        This gives us a system of 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns:
        ray_start.lon + t_ray * ray_direction.x = line_start.lon + t_seg * line_vector_x
        ray_start.lat + t_ray * ray_direction.y = line_start.lat + t_seg * line_vector_y

        Rearranging:
        t_ray * ray_direction.x - t_seg * line_vector_x = line_start.lon - ray_start.lon
        t_ray * ray_direction.y - t_seg * line_vector_y = line_start.lat - ray_start.lat

        Solving using Cramer's rule gives us t_ray and t_seg.

        VALID INTERSECTION CONDITIONS:
        - t_ray >= 0: Intersection is in front of the ray (forward direction)
        - 0 <= t_seg <= 1: Intersection is within the line segment bounds
